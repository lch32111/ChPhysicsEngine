# ChPhysicsEngine
This is my practice for 2D Physics Engine before going to the 3D

The codes here will be based on the Randy Gaul's tutorial, Box2D, Bullet Physics and so on.
I will port this codes, after making them work, to 3D Physics Engine.
And then I will integrate the 3D Physics Engine into my personal 3D Game Engine!

For the purpose of my career, I will use the DirectX11 for this engine.
So, There is other solution for DirectX practice. 

Therefore, I will follow and write physics codes along box2d in ChanPhysicsPlayGround, and then
I will follow write codes along various DirectX11 tutorials.
Finally, I will merge two codes into one for the physics demo.
