# ChPhysicsEngine
This is my practice for 2D Physics Engine before going to the 3D

The codes here will be based on the Randy Gaul's tutorial, Box2D, Bullet Physics and so on.
I will port this codes, after making them work, to 3D Physics Engine.
And then I will integrate the 3D Physics Engine into my personal 3D Game Engine!
